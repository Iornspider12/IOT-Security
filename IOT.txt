even in the 21st century a good night sleep is extremly expensive due to inconsistent security standards in current gen technology, 
The best solution I suggest is to deploy my facial recognition software in the existing CCTV cameras system. 

To give you an idea of how extreme the problem is and why my project is a suitable solution.

statistically even in the united states  60% of the Murder cases, 50% assaults,10% Vehicle theft crimes remains unsolved , 
If you look at these numbers the escape of Vehicle theft criminals 
are only of 10% but in other catagories of crime the rate is significantly higher,

this is because all the vehicles have a number plate which can be read through cctv cameras. 

Imagine if every person could be identified easily in a short amount of time.


So the basic concept of this software is to simply compare and to calculate their varience in facial parameters, 
upon recieving the amount of varience it is then decided if the faces from the images are of a same person's. 
To calculate the variance the facial recognition software uses 2 formulas MSE(Mean squared error) and SSIM(Structural similarity index), 
MSE will give a value from 0 to infinity, If the value is exactly 0 then the image will be exact copy,
if the mse value is greater than 0 the 2 images shows deviance. 
SSIM values ranges from -1 to +1,-1 being the most variant and +1 indicating the copy of the original image.

I would like to make India to be the safest place to shelter
